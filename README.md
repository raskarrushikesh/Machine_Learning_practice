# Automobile Dataset

This repository contains the Automobile dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes various attributes related to cars, such as price, engine type, horsepower, and many others. It is typically used for machine learning and data analysis tasks, especially regression and classification problems.

You can explore the data, perform feature engineering, and apply various models like decision trees, regression, or clustering algorithms.
